# Confectionery-WebsiteProject
First of all, it is created to demonstrate my personal Web-Development skills. Back-end Django framework in particular. Namely, to mimic deployed website.

I also would like to show knowledge of front-end: HTML and CSS is used here to build this website from a scratch. Full code is found on the github repository.

This website uses desserts as an examples of any type of user posts. Usage of photos is provided and approved by the baker of desserts.
