            <p>
                First of all, it is created to demonstrate my personal Web-Development skills. Back-end Django
                framework in particular. Namely, to mimic deployed website.
                <br> I also would like to show knowledge of front-end: HTML and CSS is used here to
                build this website from a scratch. Full code is found on the github repository.
                <br> This website uses desserts as an examples of any type of user posts. Usage of photos is provided
                and approved by the baker of desserts.
